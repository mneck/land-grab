    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <!-- <p>
      Left click builds a farm. Right click builds a town. Players receive points
      at the start of each turn for towns and adjacency bonuses they have on the map.
      Player 1 goes first and gets extra points each turn by building towns next to
       mountains and forests. Player 2 generates additional points by building towns
      next to mountains and water, and loses one point per turn for each of Player 1's
      adjacent towns. A player cannot have more towns than farms on the map. The first
      player to get 100 points wins.
